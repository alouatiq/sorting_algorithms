# sorting_algorithms
The sorting_algorithms repository is a C project implementing and analyzing four fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in its own file and includes code to print the array or list after each swap, aiding in visualization and debugging.
