# sorting_algorithms

The sorting_algorithms repository is a C project implementing and analyzing four fundamental sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in its own file and includes code to print the array or list after each swap, aiding in visualization and debugging.

The project also explores the Big O notation for each algorithm's time complexity across best, average, and worst-case scenarios, documented in separate files. Additional files include helper functions (print_array and print_list) for displaying arrays and doubly linked lists, respectively.

The project aims to deepen understanding of sorting mechanics, efficiency, and stability while reinforcing C programming skills and knowledge of algorithm analysis.
